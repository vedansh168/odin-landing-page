            <h1>Welcome to this Haikyuu fan page</h1>
            <p id="hero-text">
                Haikyuu is an inspirational shonen anime about volleyball, which follows the story of Hinata Shoyo, a die hard fan of volleyball
                who is only 165 cm. In his first and last ever tournament in middle school, he got crushed by Kageyama Tobio, a genius setter who had everything Hinata didn't. Vowing to defeat him in high school,
                Hinata heads to Karasuno, home of the famous Little Giant, Hinata's inspiration. And who should he see there, but Kageyama Tobio!
                This then follows the story of how Karasuno changes with these 2 and multiple other players, and they navigate the tough waters of making it to nationals.

<div class="quotes">
  <p>
    Apart from this just being a volleyball anime, it is also filled with many life lessons and wisdom. 
    This anime actually helped me through some difficulties in life, because of the characters and their stories and the 
    numerous tough situations we see the players face and overcome. I would like to share some of those quotes, which instill a lot of discipline and motivation in anyone.
